When using Siyuan Notes, you will inevitably have some doubts that puzzle you during the learning or recording process. These doubts may not affect the subsequent learning of the content, so you want to record and skip them temporarily and solve them when you have time. At this time, you need a tool that can organize all the doubt points scattered throughout the workspace to facilitate subsequent viewing and resolution.

Therefore, the **Task List** plugin came into being. It can help you quickly generate a task list for all **Task List Block** type of doubt points and place it in the `Dock` column on the right to facilitate subsequent learning.

- Document: All task nodes in the currently active open document block
- Notebook: All task nodes in the notebook to which the currently activated document block belongs

**Display form**: Task nodes in the **Notebook** and **Workspace** dimensions are displayed in a tree, which can clearly indicate the documents and notebooks to which each task node belongs; **Document** dimension The task nodes under are displayed directly in the list.
